# Draw on an iOS device using Metal ‚úèÔ∏è

## TODOs and WIP tasks ‚úÖ
Look at the the project board [here](https://github.com/OwenCalvin/hand-drawing-swift-metal/projects/1)

# How it works üìü ?
## Line system
A line is composed of a multitude of interconnected triangles, they are generated from "key point" which are the points having as coordinates the places where you have slipped your finger/pen. Several linked triangles can form a trapeze which allows to manage the force communicated with the apple pen in order to vary the width of the line on the same line.

## Interpolation
I use the Catmull Rom interpolation, it generates points between each "key points"  
*With interpolation:*

*Without interpolation (only the points that are produced from your finger/pen touches):*
